# The Need for a Requirements Document

A Lower Speck document provides a single, well-defined, programmer-friendly file to specify and change requirements throughout the lifetime of a software product.

In practice, many rapid application projects use informal requirements documents written in plain human language. These have a varying amount of detail and are difficult to cite. Often, they exist in several different documents sent over different mediums; for example, via email and ticketing systems.

Software requirements change over time, and often the full set of requirements is unclear to most or all parties with an interest in the software.

Any centralized requirements document can help clear up organizational confusion.

With a <a href="/">Lower Speck</a> document:

- Developers can identify poorly explained requirements.

- Developers can include requirement citations in code to aid in system maintenance.

- Stakeholders can see the connection between their informal documents and the software.

- Automated tools can show which requirements have been addressed.

- Changing requirements can be documented.

- No special software is strictly required.

- Even large lists of requirements stay as light-weight as possible.
